        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p class="paragraph_style">Patriot Thanks was born from a simple belief: those who serve our communities deserve
            recognition and support from local businesses. By connecting service members, veterans, first responders,
            and their families with businesses that offer meaningful discounts and incentives, we're building stronger
            community bonds while helping local businesses thrive.</p>

        <p class="paragraph_style">Our platform makes it easy for businesses to demonstrate their appreciation while
            reaching new customers who value that support. Together, we're creating a network of mutual respect and
            community support that benefits everyone involved.</p>
